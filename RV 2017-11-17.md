# New Blockchain Technologies: IELE and K
## IELE
* Gas model design outline at
https://github.com/runtimeverification/iele-semantics/wiki/Gas-Model
* Development of assembler accepting LLVM-like syntax beginning
* Implementation of function and inter-contract call semantics continues
   * Array/variable-sized argumennts
   * Signature error handling
* Pausing EVM-to-IELE translation.
    * EVM translation has provided many test cases, and now runs into
    difficulties handling safe uses of unsafe EVM features which
    do not map directly onto IELE. Directly generating safe IELE code
    from Solidity should be easier.
## K Infrastructure
* Delayed this week by IELE and EVM paper work
* K to LLVM
* Improved Symbolic backend
# Formal Analysis for EVM and Plutus
## EVM
* All HKG functions verified at ABI level
* Semantics of Viper and subset of LLL used by Viper
* Viper implementation of ERC20 also verified, with nearly idential specs!
* Revised KEVM paper submitted to PLDI!
## Plutus
* Type system implementation continues
* Received test suite from IOHK
# Organizational
Openings at RV
* Still hiring 2 FTE at RV, 1 at IOHK for K Backend
- No candidates in pipeline!
