# New Blockchain Technologies: IELE and K
## IELE
* Two major features designed, beginning implementation
    * Inter-Contract calls:    
Cotracts have explicit signature based declaration of
exported functions, and invocation targets
    * Contract creation, initialization:
Dynamic contract creation from contracts limited to
child contracts pre-compiled into parent contract code,
and cloning existing contracts.
Arbitrary contract creation will be allowed through dedicated transactions.

* Roadmap for Dec 1 release organized as [milestone in github](https://github.com/runtimeverification/iele-semantics/milestone/1).
## K Infrastructure
* LLVM Backend
    * Prototyping code generation strategies
     See <http://github.com/bmmoore/k-backend-prototypes>, at commit [0055450](https://github.com/bmmoore/k-backend-prototypes/commit/00554501bc8cd5f909b12ead92b6436feadb3c05)
        - (handwriten) Low-level interpreter runs ~1.5x faster than
          best handwritten code in high-level language (SML with mlton),
          ~10x faster than current OCaml backend
        - Applying Semantics-Based Compilation (manually) to a test
          program and using low-level implementation strategy produces
          a program at least half as fast as a direct C translation
          of the test program.
    * Prover
        - Initial work on adding symbolic variables to the Scala prototype [kale](https://github.com/kframework/kale), following futher explanations and plans from kale core contributor Cosmin Radoi. 
        
          (A small amount of work may add the functionality needed to replace the legacy Java prover)
        - Improvements in Z3 use made to legacy Java Prover
          to support current verification efforts.
          (Most important change provided by original developer Andrei Ştefănescu)
# Formal Analysis for EVM and Plutus
## EVM
* Developing EVM specification document based on KEVM semantics.
Current codename: Jellopaper.
* 5/6 HKG functions verified at ABI level
(proof-checking time and iteration rate greatly
improved by prover changes mentioned above).
* Viper and LLL semantics begun and largely functional
<https://github.com/kframework/viper-semantics>
    * Discovered some bugs in official Viper compiler
    * K does not support indentation-sensitive syntax except
     through an external parser/filter, so unmodified code
     does not yet work.
## Plutus
* Further implementation of type system - application is now supported
* Revised K representation of synthesis and checking judgements for bidirectional type checking.
# Organizational
* Radu Ometita hired at IOHK
* Denis Bogdanis hired at RV
 Denis developed the K semantics of Java in his graduate studies.
* Still hiring 2 FTE at RV, 1 at IOHK for K Backend
    - No candidates in pipeline!
* Part time internship arranged with UIUC for graduate students
